Frontgammon is a backgammon implementation written in Java for our Software Engineering class at Lamar University.

This project is for educational purposes only. It has been submitted and graded, so its chief purpose has been eliminated.

We still welcome others who wish to further develop the project. If you apply for a developer position, we will do our best to accommodate you.
