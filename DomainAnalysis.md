## General knowledge about the domain ##

Backgammon is a type of a board game usually played by two players on a board consisting of twenty four narrow triangles of alternating colors called points. These triangles are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The quadrants are referred to as two inner boards or home boards and two outer boards. Each player has home or inner board and an outer board, which are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board called the bar.

Numbering the points starts at each players beginning side and continues consecutively to the end.  This makes the first player's one point the opposing player's twenty four point. Each player starts with fifteen checkers on the board. The starting placement of checkers for each player is: two twenty-four point, five on  thirteen point, three eight point, and five six point. The checkers will be moved by the players from their starting position towards the twenty four point and eventually to bear off.

A pair of dice are used. Each player moves their checkers with regard to the number rolled with the dice. A doubling cube, which is a device used in multi-game play, is a six sided die that is used to keep track of the games progress. When the doubling cube reaches a predetermined number of points, that player wins.

The objective of the game is to move all your checkers into your own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all of their checkers wins the game.

## Customers and Users ##

This project will be a good fit for anyone interested in board games. Players are able to play on their mobile phone, PC, or on a website. Players may include those from the professional Backgammon leagues, who can use the software for a tournament, as well as casual players.

## Environment ##

This project should be capable of performing well under casual conditions and as well as tiered tournament play. The players will be able to play on the same PC or across the Internet.

## Tasks and procedures ##

This project will implement the functionality required to set up and play a simple game of Backgammon as well as functionality to host a large scale tournament within the game. The tasks of keeping up with the players and their rankings will be up to the program.

## Competing software ##

There are many different implementations of Backgammon available today. One major player is Yahoo! Backgammon. Yahoo! Backgammon is a fully featured implementation that includes a fully integrated chat system, graphical game board, tournament play, statistics tracking, and networking capabilities.  Our project will start with the same basic features as Yahoo's version.
Similarities across domains

Backgammon is similar to other board games in much of its functionality. Like many others, there are two players, a game board, dice, and a tournament system. This functionality will largely be the same with regard to any game chosen to develop.
